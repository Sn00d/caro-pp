    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how Caro ("we", "our", or "extension") handles data when you use our browser extension. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our data practices.</p>

        <li>Does not track browsing history outside of car.gr</li>
        <li>Does not transmit data to external servers</li>
        <li>Does not use analytics or tracking services</li>
